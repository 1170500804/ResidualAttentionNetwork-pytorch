# ResidualAttentionNetwork-pytorch
A pytorch code about Residual Attention Network.  

This code is based on two  projects from 

https://github.com/liudaizong/Residual-Attention-Network 
and 
https://github.com/fwang91/residual-attention-network/blob/master/imagenet_model/Attention-92-deploy.prototxt

The first project is the pytorch code, but i think some network detail is not good. So I modify it according to 
the architechure of the Attention-92-deploy.prototxt.

And I also add the ResidualAttentionModel_92 for training imagenet,
ResidualAttentionModel_448input for larger image input,
and ResidualAttentionModel_92_32input_update for training cifar10.

# how to train?
first, download the data from http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
make sure the varible 
# 
is_train = True
#
then python train.py

you can train on ResidualAttentionModel_56 or ResidualAttentionModel_448input, only should modify the code in train.py
from  "from model.residual_attention_network import ResidualAttentionModel_92 as ResidualAttentionModel" to
"from model.residual_attention_network import ResidualAttentionModel_56 as ResidualAttentionModel"

# how to test?
make sure the varible 
#
is_train = False
#
then python train.py

# result
I have tested on ResidualAttentionModel_92_32input_update on cifar10 test set, the result is as following:
# 
Accuracy of the model on the test images: 0.954
#
Accuracy of plane : 96 %
Accuracy of   car : 97 %
Accuracy of  bird : 93 %
Accuracy of   cat : 90 %
Accuracy of  deer : 95 %
Accuracy of   dog : 92 %
Accuracy of  frog : 97 %
Accuracy of horse : 96 %
Accuracy of  ship : 97 %
Accuracy of truck : 97 %
current best acc, 0.954
which is better than the result in paper of 0.9501.
the paper only give the archietcture details of attention_92 for imagenet with 224 input but not for cifar10. So I build the net following my understanding. I have not struggled for optimizing the code, so maybe you can do better based my code.
